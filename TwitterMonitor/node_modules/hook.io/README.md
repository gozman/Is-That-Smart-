    a full featured i/o framework for node.js
    
# v0.7.4

## hook.io creates a distributed node.js EventEmitter that works cross-process / cross-platform / cross-browser. Think of it like a real-time event bus that works anywhere JavaScript is supported.

## You create custom i/o scenarios by picking and choosing from an extensive library of tiny, independent, autonomous "hooks" that seamlessly work together.

### 20 Video lessons available at: [http://youtube.com/maraksquires](http://youtube.com/maraksquires) and [http://github.com/hookio/tutorials](http://github.com/hookio/tutorials)

# Features :

- Build large, decoupled, distributed, and fault tolerant I/O heavy applications in node.js
- Create hooks on ANY device that supports JavaScript (cross-browser support via [socket.io][1])
- Throw any block of sync or async code on a new process with a callback
- Easily scale any tcp based messaging infrastructure (such as clustering socket.io chat rooms in memory) 
- Interprocess Message Publishing and Subscribing done through [EventEmitter2][2] and [dnode][3]
- Messaging API inherits and mimics Node's native EventEmitter API (with the help of EventEmitter2)
- Spawning and Daemonizing of processes handled with [Forever][4]
- Easily connect / disconnect hooks "hot" without affecting other services
- Core library currently checking in at about ~450 lines of code

# Getting Start / Demo

     npm install hook.io-helloworld -g

Now run:

     hookio-helloworld
     
Spawn up as many as you want. The first one becomes a server, the rest will become clients. Each helloworld hook emits a hello on an interval. Now watch the i/o party go!

## Tests

All tests are written with [vows][7] and require that you link hook.io to itself:

``` bash
  $ cd /path/to/hook.io
  $ [sudo] npm link
  $ [sudo] npm link hook.io
  $ npm test
```
